# Integrated Project 1

## Introduction

You work for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources.

The dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating such as Teen or Mature.

## Goal

spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.
